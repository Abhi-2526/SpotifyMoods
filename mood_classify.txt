# Music Mood Classification Guide

## Overview
This document details how to classify songs into moods based on audio features. The system can assign up to 3 moods per song, with confidence levels determining primary, secondary, and weak mood classifications.

## Confidence Thresholds
- Primary Mood: ≥ 0.70 confidence
- Secondary Mood: ≥ 0.60 confidence
- Weak Mood: ≥ 0.50 confidence
- Maximum moods per song: 3

## Mood Classifications

### Energetic
- Energy: 0.60 - 1.00
- Valence: 0.35 - 1.00
- Confidence Weight: 0.90
- Characteristics: High-energy songs with moderate to positive emotional tone

### Dark
- Valence: 0.00 - 0.35 (negative emotional tone)
- Energy: 0.45 - 1.00
- Confidence Weight: 0.85
- Characteristics: Energetic songs with negative emotional tone

### Danceable
- Danceability: 0.65 - 1.00
- Energy: 0.45 - 1.00
- Confidence Weight: 0.90
- Characteristics: High danceability with significant energy

### Dark Dance
- Danceability: 0.65 - 1.00
- Valence: 0.00 - 0.40
- Energy: 0.45 - 1.00
- Confidence Weight: 0.85
- Characteristics: Danceable songs with negative emotional tone

### Electronic
- Acousticness: 0.00 - 0.30
- Instrumentalness: 0.00 - 0.90
- Confidence Weight: 0.80
- Characteristics: Strong electronic elements, low acoustic presence

### Acoustic
- Acousticness: 0.60 - 1.00
- Instrumentalness: 0.00 - 0.70
- Confidence Weight: 0.80
- Characteristics: Predominantly acoustic instruments

### Melancholic
- Valence: 0.00 - 0.35
- Energy: 0.00 - 0.45
- Tempo: 0 - 110 BPM
- Confidence Weight: 0.85
- Characteristics: Slow, sad songs with low energy

### Upbeat
- Valence: 0.55 - 1.00
- Energy: 0.55 - 1.00
- Tempo: 90 - 180 BPM
- Confidence Weight: 0.85
- Characteristics: Fast, positive songs with high energy

## Fallback System
If no moods meet the threshold criteria, the system assigns fallbacks based on dominant features:

### High Energy Fallbacks (Energy ≥ 0.6)
- High Valence (≥ 0.5): Energetic
- Low Valence (< 0.5): Dark

### Dance Fallbacks (Danceability ≥ 0.6)
- High Valence (≥ 0.5): Danceable
- Low Valence (< 0.5): Dark Dance

### Production Character Fallbacks
- High Acousticness (≥ 0.5): Acoustic
- Low Acousticness (≤ 0.3): Electronic

### Emotional Fallbacks
- Low Valence (≤ 0.3): Melancholic
- High Valence (≥ 0.6): Upbeat

### Final Fallbacks (Energy-based)
- Energy ≥ 0.5: Moderate Energy
- Energy < 0.5: Calm

## Confidence Calculation
Confidence is calculated using:
1. Distance from ideal range midpoint
2. Weighted by mood's confidence weight
3. Adjusted by a base confidence of 0.85 + (0.15 * centrality)

All fallback moods are assigned a confidence of 0.55 or 0.50 (for final fallbacks).
